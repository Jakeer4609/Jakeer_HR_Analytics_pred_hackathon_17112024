HI Noor/Zia,

I have build the model without pipeline and added all my observations and also tried different models for outcome.

I have picked randomclassifier from above models and build the pipeline for it. Then used the pickle fiule for fastapi and web deployment.

I successfully ran both fastapi and web deployment via terminal(from local) and attachef the result in GIT.

I am facing issue with GCP deployment for both api and web deployment. I will work it out and get it resolved bfore next class.

Thanks,
jakeer Hussain.
